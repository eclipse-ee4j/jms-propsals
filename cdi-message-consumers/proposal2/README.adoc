# CDI ApplicationScoped

Use of CDI ApplicationScoped beans could easily be supported by the Jakarta EE Connector Architecture.  These beans would be visible via the BeanManager without concerns of a scope that is not enabled.

## Assumptions

Assumes the Messaging implementation has a CDI Extension or some ability to scan all the CDI beans to look for Messaging API annotated methods.

## Advantages

 - Identical to Jakarta REST's support of @ApplicationScoped on HTTP Message consumers

 - An application could consume both Jakarta REST and Jakarta Messaging messages on the same bean and methods

## Limitations/Drawbacks

Potential Thread safety issues.

## Open Questions

 - Would it be desirable to have something like EJBs `@Lock` annotation on CDI ApplicationScoped beans so the user can have container-managed thread safety?

## Depends on Proposals

 - annotation-based-api

## Depends on Specifications

 - Jakarta CDI
