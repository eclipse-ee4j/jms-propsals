# CDI RequestScoped

Use of CDI RequestScoped beans could also be supported by the Jakarta EE Connector Architecture.

JAX-RS allows for both ApplicationScoped and RequestScoped CDI Beans. RequestScoped beans live for the life of the HTTP Request.  For JMS the bean would live for the life of the JMS Message delivery.  This would obviously be very short and consuming multiple messages in a row could add overhead.

## Assumptions

- Assumes the Messaging implementation has a CDI Extension or some ability to scan all the CDI beans to look for Messaging API annotated methods.

## Advantages

 - Identical to Jakarta REST's support of @RequestScoped on HTTP Message consumers

 - An application could consume both Jakarta REST and Jakarta Messaging messages on the same bean and methods

## Limitations/Drawbacks

 - CDI @RequestScoped creates a new bean instance each request which can potentially be wasteful if there is a high volume of messages.

## Open Questions

## Depends on Proposals

 - annotation-based-api

## Depends on Specifications

 - Jakarta CDI
